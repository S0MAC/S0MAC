### 🤓 Developer Humor

💡 *Why do programmers prefer dark mode?* Because light attracts bugs! 🐞

🖥️ *How do you comfort a JavaScript developer?* You console them! 😆

📟 *Why did the developer go broke?* Because he used up all his cache! 💸

Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer. 🔍
